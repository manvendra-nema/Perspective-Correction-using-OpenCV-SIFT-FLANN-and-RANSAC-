# Perspective-Correction-using-OpenCV-SIFT-FLANN-and-RANSAC-
This project corrects perspective distortion in images using SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), FLANN-based feature matching, and RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) to compute a homography matrix. The process enables deskewing of images and aligning them to a reference template.
